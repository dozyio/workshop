Welcome to your first Rust lesson! In this lesson, you'll write a simple program that does nothing but comiles and runs.

## Introduction

Before you can start learning how to program in Rust, you need to get through setting up a basic project that compiles and runs. If you followed the setup instructions already, you should already have the solution to this lesson because `cargo init` generates a simple Rust application for you.

## Your Task

Create a Rust program that compiles

To complete this task:

1. Follow the setup instructions listed in the workshop selection dialog.

## Hint - Complete Solution

Here's the complete solution. Make sure you have this code in your `src/main.rs` file:

```rust
fn main() {
}
```

To run this program, you would typically use the `cargo run` command, but for this lesson, the check command will compile and run your code for you.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on writing your first Rust program! This simple example demonstrates the basic structure of a Rust program and prepares you for the next lesson.
